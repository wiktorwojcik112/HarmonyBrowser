---------------
**Harmony** is a lightweight browser for iOS and macOS devices. It provides many features that will make your web experience better. At the same time, Harmony doesn't slow down your device.

### TO-DO:
- [x] Touch Bar support
- [x] Tabs
- [ ] Download Manager **(in work)**
- [ ] Homepage **(in work)**
- [ ] Memory limiter (option to limit the RAM memory that Harmony can use, so it won't slow down other apps)
- [ ] Network usage limiter (option to limit network usage by Harmony, so it won't use too much of your mobile data)
